# ASN nginx proxy container

## Requirements

- docker
- docker-compose

## Install

``` sh
docker-compose up -d
```

### Add a (proxied) webapp

Add the `A` and `AAAA` entries in the authoritative DNS server, then run the
container with a `docker-compose.yml` file that looks like this:

``` yml
version: '3.6'

services:
  the-webapp:
    image: someuser/some-webapp
    expose:
      - "3000"
    environment:
      - VIRTUAL_PORT=3000
      - VIRTUAL_HOST=webapp.sansnom.org
      - LETSENCRYPT_HOST=webapp.sansnom.org
      - LETSENCRYPT_EMAIL=sysadmin@sansnom.org
    networks:
      - web_proxy

networks:
    web_proxy:
      external:
        name: web_proxy
```

- `3000` is the port used by the app's web server in this example
- `webapp.sansnom.org` is the domain name to reach the web app
- `sysadmin@sansnom.org` is the e-mail address for certificate renewal reminders


## What's inside?

### docker-compose.yml

Defines 3 containers:

- nginx-proxy, regular nginx server
- nginx-docker-gen, configuration generator for nginx using docker-gen
- letsencrypt-http, letsencrypt client (simp_le) to get domain name certificates

### nginx.tmpl

Contains the default template from jwilder/nginx-proxy (downloaded 2019-10-24)
used to generate nginx configuration file.

## Goal and current state

We want

- safety (for access and data)
- stability (against crashes)
- free software (if we run it, you too should be able to)

We rely on images made by other people as a starting point, but the plan is to
build the images ourselves in the future.

We are using the HTTP-01 challenge, but we plan to use the DNS-01 challenge to
get a wildcard certificate in the future.
